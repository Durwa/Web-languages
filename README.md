### HTML, XHTML, and CSS

- The most commonly used and broadly applicable web language is HTML, 
- which stands for HyperText Markup Language. ... While most web browsers perform some basic visual formatting of HTML de facto, 
- we will need to rely upon CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets to make our pages look awesome.
